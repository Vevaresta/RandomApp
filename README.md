Application that I use to implement the tech that I'm learning about. 
It's a little bit of a Frankenstein, used only for practice and learning purposes.

What I already implemented:

- Domain Driven Design
- Server Logging (NLog)
- API Route Testing with Swagger
- Mocking Objects (Moq)
- Authentification and Authorization (OAuth)
- Frontend Components for Products and Product Details (Blazor)
- Background Services to fetch Data from a Public API (Random Product Data)
- Connection with the MSSQL Database (Entity Framework Core)
- Communication with the Database with Repository and Unit of Work Patterns
- CRUD Functions for REST API Controller
- Automapper
- Global Exception Handling Middleware
